# Tweetify

This repository offers an illustrative demonstration of a Twitter API clone, which is designed for **educational purposes and personal learning**. It's important to emphasize that this project is purely for fun and for the enrichment of individual understanding. While it mimics the functionality of Twitter's API, it's crucial to note that it is **not** affiliated with the official Twitter platform. Instead, it serves as a learning tool for exploring the concepts and mechanics behind building social media APIs.
